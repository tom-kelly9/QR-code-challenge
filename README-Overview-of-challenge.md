### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project took around 40 minutes. Creating the structure and design was easy enough. the most difficult thing was centering the container to the middle of the page. 

### Continued development
Deciding whether to use flexbox or grid is still something im unsure on. also how to use each well. I will look to learn more about this in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Freecodecamp article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-center-anything-with-css-align-a-div-text-and-more/) - This helped me to center my container.
